# The absolute file system path where either the application directory or the
# Git working directory will be located.
#
# When a Vagrant box is used this path has to be any value other than /home/vagrant

# Example: server.js
nodejs_app_start_script: ''

# Enabling this will manage the application using https://github.com/remy/nodemon
